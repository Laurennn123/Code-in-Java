EMBEDDING SELECTING FONT ON GOOGLE FONT AND COPYING THE CODE

TYPOGRAPHY FOR DESIGN OF THE FONT(SERIF FONT FOR AUTHORITATIVE AND SAN-SERIF MORE APPROACHABLE WHICH THEY HAVE TYPEFACE LIKE GILL SANS, TAHOMA, VERDANA THAT CAN USE FOR BODY TYPES)
USE TWO FONTS AT A TIME IN A POSTER OR A WEBSITE
CHOOSE SERIF OR SAN SERIF FOR PROFESSIONAL DESIGN THAT APPROACHABLE FOR READER

font-size: 90px; 16px = 100% = 1em (use rem most least error-prone when applying fontsize but when it comes on margin use pixel)

Position property(static,relative,absolute and fixed)
static is the default
when relative you just put margin on the position by coordinates
if absolute you will put exactly of position by coordinates
fixed it stays the content on its position by coordinates example on when dragging
float: - to float image that wrapped in text not inline or inline block 
(DONT USE IT FOR POSITIONING use for the cases of wrapping text)
clear: - to antifloat of anything on default behavior that its wrapped 

The Box Model
{padding : 20;} to increase the size of the box
{margin : 10;} outside of the box
{border : solid;} border of the box
circle shorthands identifying its all four sides {border-width : 0,10,20,30;}

when centering the elements text-align: center; then if have width: 10%; use margin like the circle shorthands margin: 10px auto;

giving value in a line height without any units.


Javascript

javscript that telling on elements in html that how it should do 

FB TWIT SKYPE - ANDREESSEN HOROWITZ
mosiac is the first browser by marc then next is netscape (the beginning of web browsing)
Brendan Eich who create the JS in 10days

Livescript -> Jscript -> ECMAscript

FUNCTION or KEYWORD

alert("HELLO"); = pop up on the screen
typeof();= determine what data type
prompt(); = asking the user 
var = means variable. example of syntax var myFaveNumber = 6; to change the store in variable no need to repeat the keyword just type what name of the variable like 
myFaveNumber = 7; then it is 7

// = comment
alert("My name is " + myName + " and my favorite number is " + yourNumber); 
syntax that so many spaces


data types(String,numbers and boolean)

naming of variables = use the camel casing lowercase then next is capitalized

concatenation is the plus sign combining of the variables or the others


ATTRIBUTES (KEYWORD) = can attributes in close parenthesis just like this
alert(prompt("Introduce Yourself").slice(0,140)); 

length = looking of how many characters inside of a String
slice = slicing the characters example: var name = "Lauren"; name.slice(0,4); the output is "Laur" it starts with zero tat ends up on four in short to know the output the ending position minus the start position.

SOLVED CHALLENGE

JS

var writtenChar = prompt("Introduce Yourself");
var written = writtenChar.length;
// var limitOfChar = 224;
// alert("You have written " + written + " characters, you have -" + (limitOfChar-written) + " characters left.");
var slice = writtenChar.slice(0,140);
var test = "LAUREN ANDRE LAUREN ANDRE LAUREN ANDRE LAUREN ANDRE  LAUREN ANDRE  LAUREN ANDRE  LAUREN ANDRE  LAUREN ANDRE  LAUREN ANDRE  LAUREN ANDRE  LAU0";
alert("THIS IS ONLY THE LIMIT :" + slice + test.length);

can apply this way
alert(prompt("Introduce Yourself").slice(0,140));
